      <p> The Airline that always maintained ontime arrival above 90% in period of 2003-2015 is Hawaiian Airlines Inc. By this plot, its clearly looking like Hawaiian Airlines Inc. performing seriously well, and Delta just able to perfrom above 85% in recent years. 
      
      But when we check the plot of Volume of Arrivals, this clearly show the reasons of why Hawaiian Airlines performing well. 
      
      As an example of year 2013, when Hawaiin Airline performing at 93% On Time Arrival, and Delta Airlines at 85%. But when we see the plot of Volume of Arrivals of same year, the Delta Airlines is at 754K total Arrivals & Hawaiin Airlines at 72K. The Delta Airline total flights arrivals volume is approx 10 times more than Hawaiin. In this sense the Delta is not at all performing bad in comparision to Hawaiin.
