This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#setwd('C:/Users/kaku/Desktop/Project 6')
df <- read.csv('main_data.csv')
str(df)
library(dplyr)

summary(df$date)



ef <- df %>%
  group_by(X.month, year, carrier_name) %>%
  summarize(arrivals = sum(arr_flights),
            delayed = sum(arr_del15),
            cancelled = sum(arr_cancelled),
            diverted = sum(arr_diverted)) %>%
  transform(on_time = arrivals - delayed)

ef <- ef[complete.cases(ef),]

pf <- ef %>%
  group_by( year) %>%
  summarize(arrivals = sum(arrivals),
            delayed = sum(delayed),
            cancelled = sum(cancelled),
            diverted = sum(diverted)) %>%
  transform(on_time = arrivals - delayed)




write.csv(ff, file="data.csv", row.names=FALSE)

```
