This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df <- read.csv('1987.csv')
hour = function(x) { return( substr(x, 0, nchar(x)-2)); }
hour(913)

library(dplyr)

summary(df$date)



ef <- df %>%
  group_by(HOUR = hour(DepTime)) %>%
  summarize(delays = mean(DepDelay)) 

ef <- ef[complete.cases(ef),]
ef <-subset(ef,HOUR > 0)



write.csv(ef, file="new_data.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
